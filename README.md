# Simple Sails.js - Bower - Vue.js Project Structure

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application configured to run bower.js and vue.js on the front end.

Note: You need to edit the bower.json file when ever you want to add more front end libraries and also edit the exportsOverride section to incorporate your newly added front end libraries.

To run..

bower install

sails lift

Enjoy!
